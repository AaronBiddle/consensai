# consensai

ConsensAI is an open-source platform that uses AI to help groups explore ideas, find common ground, and develop nuanced solutions through collaborative dialogue.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **AI-Mediated Dialogue**: Conversations are synthesized into clear, evolving perspectives
- **Nuanced Feedback**: Express agreement on a 0-10 approval scale instead of binary yes/no
- **Dynamic Understanding**: Perspectives merge or diverge based on real-time dialogue
- **Organic Evolution**: Solutions develop naturally through conversation and feedback
- **Extensible Design**: Modular architecture supporting multiple backends

## ðŸ’­ Vision

ConsensAI explores a new way for groups to collaborate and make decisions. Instead of forcing complex views into simple yes/no choices, it uses AI to help people:

- Express nuanced positions
- Find unexpected areas of agreement
- Develop solutions organically
- Reduce polarization through granular feedback
- Enable large-scale collective decision-making

We believe this approach could transform how groups collaborate, from small team decisions to large-scale social coordination.
